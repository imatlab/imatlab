A Jupyter kernel for MATLAB
===========================

**Note:** This package is no longer actively maintained.  Consider using the
official `MATLAB integration for Jupyter`_ instead.

This kernel requires Jupyter_ with Python 3.5+, and the `MATLAB engine for
Python`_ R2016b+, which needs to be installed first.  (We intentionally do not
declare a dependency on the matlabengine_ PyPI package to maintain
back-compatibility with older versions of MATLAB, for which the engine needs
to be manually installed.)  Note that additionally, Python versions not
supported by the engine are likewise not supported by the kernel.

Installation
------------

As usual, install using pip:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ pip install imatlab  # from PyPI
   $ pip install git+https://github.com/imatlab/imatlab  # from Github

Then, register the kernelspec with

.. code:: sh

   $ python -mimatlab install

In the absence of administrator rights, the ``--user`` flag should be added to
all of these commands.

Use
---

.. code:: sh

   # Notebook (in the notebook interface, select Matlab from the 'New' menu):
   $ jupyter notebook
   # or QtConsole:
   $ jupyter qtconsole --kernel imatlab
   # or terminal:
   $ jupyter console --kernel imatlab

(Note that ``imatlab`` intentionally does not declare a dependency on
any Jupyter client, as it can be used with any one of them individually.
In practice, this means that at least one of ``jupyter-notebook``,
``jupyter-qtconsole``, or ``jupyter-console`` need to be installed in addition
to ``imatlab``.)

Inline graphics
---------------

MATLAB figures can be displayed in native MATLAB windows (the default), or
(when using the notebook) as inline images.  The kernel can natively display
static images, or use Plotly_ to generate interactive
JavaScript figures.

.. _Plotly: https://plot.ly/

The exporter is set by calling the ``imatlab_export_fig`` function, which is
automatically added to the MATLAB path when the kernel is running.  The
following settings are possible:

.. code:: matlab

   imatlab_export_fig('')  % Native windows.
   imatlab_export_fig('fig2plotly')  % Plotly figures.
   imatlab_export_fig('print-png')  % Static png figures.
   imatlab_export_fig('print-svg')  % Static svg figures.
   imatlab_export_fig('print-jpeg')  % Static jpeg figures.

This call must be issued before the first figure is shown.  Note that the
non-native exporters will call ``set(0, 'defaultfigurevisible', 'off')`` to
prevent the window from being briefly displayed, whereas using native windows
turns the default figure visibility back ``'on'``.

Plotly exporter
```````````````

Plotly inline graphics in the notebook depend on plotly.py_ (>=1.13) and the
`Plotly MATLAB API`_ (>=2.2.7), which can be installed as follows:

.. _plotly.py: https://pypi.org/project/plotly/
.. _Plotly MATLAB API: https://plot.ly/matlab

1. Run ``pip install plotly`` or ``pip install --user plotly``.
2. Clone `plotly/MATLAB-Online`_ or download it as a `zip file`_.
3. Recursively add the resulting extracted folders to the MATLAB search path
   using ``addpath(genpath(<Plotly MATLAB API path>));``.  Either put such a
   call in your ``startup.m``, or then call ``savepath;`` to save the path.
4. In MATLAB, copy the required JavaScript files and initialize the
   credentials:

   .. code:: matlab

      getplotlyoffline('https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js');
      try, signin; catch, saveplotlycredentials('', ''); end;

   (If your version of MATLAB uses an old OpenSSL, you may need to use HTTP
   instead of HTTPS.)

At the beginning of each notebook, you may then call
``imatlab_export_fig('fig2plotly')`` to use automatically Plotly inline
graphics (no further calls to the Plotly API are required; in particular,
ignore the output from ``getplotlyoffline``).

.. _plotly/MATLAB-Online: https://github.com/plotly/MATLAB-Online
.. _zip file: https://github.com/plotly/MATLAB-api/archive/master.zip

Static exporters
````````````````

The static exporters (png, svg, and jpeg) do not required additional
dependencies.

The default size of exported figures, as well as whether to display figures
before exporting them, should be set using standard figure properties (``set(0,
'defaultpaperposition', [left, bottom, width, height]);``, etc.).

Custom exporters
````````````````

For further customization, you may override the ``imatlab_export_fig`` function
(the default version is provided by ``imatlab`` and added to the MATLAB path).
This function is called with no arguments after each notebook cell is executed,
while the current directory is temporarily switched to a temporary folder; this
function should return a cell array of filenames with ``.html``, ``.png``, or
``.jpg``/``.jpeg`` extension.  The corresponding files, which should have been
created by the function, will be loaded into the notebook.

Environment variables
---------------------

``IMATLAB_CONNECT``
   If this environment variable is set to a valid MATLAB identifier, the kernel
   will attempt to connect to the shared engine with that name.  If it is set
   to another non-empty value, it will connect to any existing shared engine.

``IMATLAB_CD``
   If this environment variable is set, the engine's working directory will be
   changed to match the kernel's working directory.

``IMATLAB_CONNECT`` needs to be set outside of MATLAB (as it is checked before
the connection to the engine is made).  Other environment variables can be set
either outside of MATLAB (before starting the kernel) or from within MATLAB
(using ``setenv``).

Asynchronous output
-------------------

A construct such as ``1, pause(1), 2`` will output ``1`` and ``2`` with a one
second interval on Linux and OSX, but together after a one second wait on
Windows.  PRs improving Windows support are welcome.

Asynchronous output using ``timer`` objects seem to be completely unsupported
by the MATLAB engine for Python.

MATLAB debugger
---------------

The MATLAB debugger is cleared (``dbclear all``) before each execution, as
interactive input is not supported by the engine API.

Differences with the Calysto MATLAB Kernel
------------------------------------------

- History is read from and written to MATLAB's own ``History.xml``, and thus
  shared with standard MATLAB sessions.  Note that if the file does not exist
  (e.g. if the **don't save history file** option is set, or in a console-only
  setup), history will not be reloaded into later sessions.  (A PR for loading
  ``history.m`` instead would be welcome; it would need to properly parse
  multiline inputs in that file.)
- Synchronous output is supported on Linux and OSX (see above).
- There is no magics systems, as MATLAB already provides many functions for
  this purpose (``cd``, ``edit``, etc.).
- Inline graphics can be based on ``plotly``, and thus interactive.

Tests
-----

Run tests with ``python -munittest`` or pytest_ after installing the kernel and
jupyter_kernel_test_.
